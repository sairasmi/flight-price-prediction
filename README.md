# flight-price-prediction
**‚úàÔ∏èFlight Price Prediction Data Science Projectüåê**

This project focuses on the application of data science techniques to predict flight prices accurately, aiming to address the challenges associated with the dynamic nature of airfares.

**Objective:**
The primary goal is to develop a predictive model that leverages historical data, machine learning algorithms, and real-time market trends to empower users with insights for informed decision-making in ‚úàÔ∏è air travel planning.

**üìä Tasks:**

1. **Data Collection and Cleaning:**
   - Import the flight price prediction dataset.
   - Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and perform necessary data transformations.

2. **Descriptive Statistics Analysis:**
   - Calculate the mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation for relevant numerical variables.

3. **Data Visualization:**
   - Create appropriate visualizations (e.g., histograms, box plots, bar charts) to analyze the distribution of numerical variables and relationships between categorical and numerical variables.

4. **Geographical Analysis:**
   - Develop visualizations, such as heatmaps, to understand the density of flight prices across different locations.
   - Identify areas with the highest concentration of flights and price variations.

5. **Relationship Analysis:**
   - Investigate the relationship between flight price, airline, source, destination, and other relevant factors.
   - Perform statistical tests (e.g., t-test, ANOVA) to identify significant differences in prices based on various factors.

6. **Predictive Modeling:**
   - Develop machine learning models to predict flight prices based on historical data and relevant features.
   - Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.

7. **Analysis of Customer Satisfaction:**
   - Explore the relationship between customer satisfaction and factors such as price, airline, and travel time.
   - Utilize metrics like reviews and ratings to measure customer satisfaction.

**üó∫Ô∏è Dataset:**
The dataset utilized for this analysis contains historical flight data, including information on airlines, sources, destinations, prices, and customer reviews.

**Project Structure:**
- `data` directory: Contains the raw data file.
- `notebooks` directory: Includes Jupyter notebooks for data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and predictive modeling.
- `media` directory: Contains visualizations generated during the analysis.
- `README.md` file: Provides an overview of the project.

**üöÄGetting Started:**
To run the code, Python 3 and Jupyter Notebook are required. The dataset can be downloaded from [<a href="data/Data_Train.xlsx">source</a>] or the GitHub repository.
